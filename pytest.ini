# Q. What does the below line about markers do?
#    That is, "marks tests as slow (deselect with '-m "not slow"')""
# A. It marks tests as slow, and we are ignoring the deprecation warnings because we are
#    using deprecated code in the tests.
#    We should remove the deprecated code and remove this line.
# TODO: Remove the deprecated code and remove this line.
