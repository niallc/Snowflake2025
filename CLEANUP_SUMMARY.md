# Repository Cleanup Summary

## Files Deleted (Redundant Processing Scripts)

The following files were deleted as they were replaced by `safe_shard_processing.py`:

- `smart_shard_processing.py` - Old unsafe processing script
- `fast_data_processing.py` - Old unsafe processing script  
- `force_fast_processing.py` - Old unsafe processing script
- `smart_fast_processing.py` - Old unsafe processing script
- `process_all_data.py` - Used old DataProcessor class
- `process_data.py` - Used old DataProcessor class
- `test_processing_speed.py` - Tests old processing methods
- `test_sharding_output.log` - Old test output
- `corrupted_games.log` - Old error log
- `terminal_output_guidance_for_cursor_agent.md` - Outdated Cursor guidance
- `terminal_output/` directory - Old log files

## Cache Directories Cleaned

- `__pycache__/` directories (Python bytecode cache)
- `.pytest_cache/` directories (Pytest cache)

## Files Kept (Important Functionality)

### Core Processing
- `safe_shard_processing.py` - Current safe processing script
- `test_memory_monitoring.py` - Memory monitoring tests
- `test_safe_processing.py` - Safe processing tests
- `SAFE_PROCESSING_GUIDE.md` - Documentation

### Library Code
- `hex_ai/` directory - Core library functionality
  - `data_processing.py` - Still used by training scripts
  - `data_utils.py` - Core conversion functions
  - `models.py` - Neural network models
  - `training.py` - Training functionality
  - `dataset.py` - Dataset classes
  - `config.py` - Configuration constants

### Training Scripts
- `train_real_data.py` - Training with real data
- `train_example.py` - Example training script

### Debug/Development
- `debug_win_detection.py` - Debug win detection
- `display_test_cases.py` - Display test cases
- `exploratory_hyperparameter_tuning.py` - Future hyperparameter tuning

### Configuration
- `requirements.txt` - Dependencies
- `pytest.ini` - Test configuration
- `.gitignore` - Git ignore rules

## Memory Safety Improvements

The new `safe_shard_processing.py` includes:

1. **Memory Monitoring**: Checks memory usage every 5,000 games
2. **Emergency Shutdown**: Graceful handling of Ctrl+C and system signals
3. **Process Cleanup**: Properly terminates child processes
4. **Reduced Parallelism**: Uses 4 workers instead of 8
5. **Incremental Processing**: Reads files one at a time until enough games for a shard

## Remaining Considerations

### Library Code
The `hex_ai/data_processing.py` file contains:
- `DataProcessor` class (unused after cleanup)
- `create_processed_dataloader` function (used by exploratory script)

**Recommendation**: Keep the file for now since the exploratory script uses it. Could extract just the needed function later if desired.

### Test Files
The debug and test files (`debug_win_detection.py`, `display_test_cases.py`) are kept as they might be useful for development.

### Exploratory Scripts
The `exploratory_hyperparameter_tuning.py` is kept as it could be useful for future hyperparameter optimization.

## Repository State

The repository is now cleaner with:
- ✅ Redundant processing scripts removed
- ✅ Cache directories cleaned
- ✅ Safe processing script in place
- ✅ Memory monitoring and emergency shutdown
- ✅ Proper documentation
- ✅ Core functionality preserved

The main processing workflow is now:
1. Use `safe_shard_processing.py` for data processing
2. Use `train_real_data.py` for training
3. Use `exploratory_hyperparameter_tuning.py` for hyperparameter optimization
